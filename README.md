## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Simple HTML markup
- SCSS

### What I learned

This was a great little project to get used to the workflow. I have used this as a starter project so I can get github set up and practice using SCSS in Visual Studio Code (I used to use Dreamweaver).

### Continued development

I'd love to continue doing some projects like these to learn advanced CSS, flexbox layouts, JS and to build on my existing development knowledge.

### Useful resources

- [Udemy Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - This udemy course is absolutely brilliant. Great for going back to the basics of HTML & CSS and building on my existing development skills. Looking forward to getting to the JS section as I have very little knowledge of JS.
- [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs) - Invaluable as always! Great for referring to when code doesn't quite work the way it should.
